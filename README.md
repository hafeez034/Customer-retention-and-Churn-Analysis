# Customer-retention-and-Churn-Analysis


## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer subscription types, tenure, churn rates, and technical support tickets to provide insights into customer behavior, service usage, and operational challenges. The goal is to identify patterns that influence customer retention and churn, helping businesses make informed decisions to improve customer satisfaction and service delivery.

## Key Objectives

- **Analyze Subscription Types:** Identify the distribution and popularity of different subscription plans.
- **Customer Tenure Analysis:** Evaluate how long customers remain subscribed to specific services and how tenure varies across different customer segments.
- **Churn Rate Analysis:** Examine customer churn to identify patterns and factors contributing to subscription cancellations.
- **Technical Issue Tickets:** Analyze the frequency and types of technical issues reported, and assess their impact on customer satisfaction and churn.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **Power BI:** For interactive data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **SQL:** For querying and managing the underlying data.
- **Excel:** Used for preliminary data cleaning and manipulation.

## Key Features of the Dashboard

1. **Subscription Type Breakdown:** A detailed view of the different service plans offered, including customer distribution across each plan.
2. **Customer Tenure Analysis:** Insights into how long customers stay subscribed to services, segmented by various factors such as subscription type and region.
3. **Churn Rate Visualization:** A clear view of monthly churn rates, highlighting trends and potential causes of customer cancellations.
4. **Technical Issue Analysis:** Visualization of common technical problems faced by customers, including ticket volume and resolution times.
5. **Churn vs. Technical Issues:** A comparative analysis to understand the relationship between technical support issues and customer churn.

## Insights Gained

- A strong correlation between prolonged technical issues and higher churn rates.
- Popular subscription plans tend to have lower churn, but customers on higher-tier plans are more likely to report technical issues.
- Tenure is a key indicator of loyalty, and customers with higher tenure are less likely to churn, despite occasional technical challenges.
